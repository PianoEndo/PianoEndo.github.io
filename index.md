## About My Project

Chronic pain (CP) is a type of pain that persists beyond three to six months ([Treede et al., 1003](https://oce-ovid-com.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/article/00006396-201506000-00006/HTML)). In the United States alone, about 20% of adults have some form of CP ([Dahlhamer, 1003](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2113734137/fulltextPDF/FCC61C1121774C72PQ/1?accountid=10422)). Researchers have traditionally assumed there is a linear relationship between tissue damage and pain symptoms. However, in the past 4-5 decades, a new theory accounting for social and psychological factors has emerged: the biopsychosocial model ([Engel](https://www.proquest.com/docview/1041810547?accountid=10422)). This framework points to a dynamic relationship between symptoms and complex environmental factors. Despite its popularity, systematic issues have barred integrative pain care principles from being widely operationalized ([Ng](https://oce-ovid-com.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/article/00006396-202108000-00002/HTML)). The patient-clinician relationship (PCR) can be a promising aspect for implementing the biopsychosocial model of pain as well as creating impactful patient engagement and tackling disparities in healthcare.
My project aims to identify the effectiveness of therapeutic tangibles, toys, and interactive interfaces in lowering the psychological barriers for effective communication between patients and healthcare providers.
