## July 4th
- Finished my abstract for Leadership Alliance
- Looked into information about sound recorder and its components
	- Microphone: inputs analogue voice pattern
	- Circuit: converts analogue to digital
    - Speaker: outputs analogue voice pattern transmitted from the Serial DAC


## July 5th
- Looked further into information about sound recorder ([reference](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN278.pdf))
	- Push-button and LED light
		- takes analogue voice as an input
		- notifies that itâ€™s recording with the red light

	- ADC (Analogue to Digital Converter)
		- converts the analog voice pattern to digital (12-bit)
		- uses DPCM (Differential Pulse Code Modulation) to compress the digital sample (6 bits) sends the signal to MCU

	- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) flash memory
		- stores voice data
		- bigger the memory is, longer it can record
		- has to be more than 720kB to record for 2 minutes (8kHz sampling rate)

	- Serial DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter)
		- translates the digital format to the original analogue voice sends data to the speaker

## July 6th
- Looked into information about Ecoflex
