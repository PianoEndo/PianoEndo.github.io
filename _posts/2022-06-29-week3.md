July 4th - 8th
## July 4th
- Finished my abstract for Leadership Alliance National Symposium
- Looked into information about sound recorder and its components
	- Microphone: inputs analogue voice pattern
	- Circuit: converts analogue to digital
    - Speaker: outputs analogue voice pattern transmitted from the Serial DAC


## July 5th
- Looked further into information about sound recorder ([reference](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN278.pdf))
	- Push-button and LED light
		- takes analogue voice as an input
		- notifies that it’s recording with the red light

	- ADC (Analogue to Digital Converter)
		- converts the analog voice pattern to digital (12-bit)
		- uses DPCM (Differential Pulse Code Modulation) to compress the digital sample (6 bits) sends the signal to MCU

	- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) flash memory
		- stores voice data
		- bigger the memory is, longer it can record
		- has to be more than 720kB to record for 2 minutes (8kHz sampling rate)

	- Serial DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter)
		- translates the digital format to the original analogue voice sends data to the speaker

## July 6th
- step by step instruction on Smooth-on products
	- Mix Ecoflex 00-35
	- Apply Ecoflex as the first layer
	- Wait for 4 minutes
	- Repeat 3rd and 4th step for 4 more times
	- Wet Gypsona plaster bandages with warm water
	- Apply the bandages on the ecoflex as a supporting shell
	- Demold
	- Mix Smooth-Cast 325
	- Pours Smooth-Cast 325 into the mold
	- Demold

- compared characteristics of different products
	- How To Make a Silicone Mold of a Hand - Ecoflex® 00-35

## July 7th
- looked into exhibition design to increase the awareness on chronic pain
	- display methods
    	- put on the wall
		- hung from the ceiling
		- put on the table
	- medium
    	- panels
		- wooden boards
		- cutting sheet
		- acrylic
		- silicone
    - navigations
    	- state the research purpose and touch on chronic pain and PCR
		- encourage the visitors to interact with therapeutic tangibles and listen to the voice of the patients recorded inside the tangibles

## July 8th
- had a meeting with the project members and shared my findings
